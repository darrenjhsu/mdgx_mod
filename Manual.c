		 "device's block scheduler as a queueing system of sorts.  "
		 "This paradigm shift in GPU utilization can backfill idle "
		 "SMPs to reap enormous gains in total throughput on small "
		 "systems (928 atoms maximum) and may even exceed the "
		 "simulation rate of pmemd.cuda for very small systems (less "
		 "than 225 atoms).  While it offers RATTLE, the equivalent of "
		 "SHAKE for mdgx's velocity-Verlet integrator, the module "
		 "also offers a velocity-Verlet I/r-RESPA multi-time stepping "
		 "scheme which performs at least as well as SHAKE in most "
		 "cases, and often considerably better in terms of speed and "

		 "independent copies on all of the GPU's SMPs.", 79, NULL,

		 "therefore advantageous, if trying to simulate many systems "
		 "of disparate sizes, to queue up many more systems than the "
		 "size of the block grid (which will be determined by the "
